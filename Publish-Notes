We have been working hard to get everything in that is needed for you to have your first successful mob programming session. We're about to start the second half of the book on how to go from your first session to a high performing mob.

Please give us any and all feedback either through email or twitter. And than you so much for all of your support. A special thanks to the first three people who actually paid for the book. We can't express the amount of motivation we got from that.
